#attendance_probability.py 
1. In order to solve the method, i tried approaching the problem statement using probability itself but involving memorization to cache the result of the state using a dict. 
I used type hints to help me have a better clear idea of what can be the return values.

#attendance_backtracking.py
2. In the other solution, i tried backtracking solution to generate most likely possible sequences and filter among them as there is a chance to generate invalid_sequences as well.
